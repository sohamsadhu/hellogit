{\bf Problem Definition:} Formal description of the search problem.

{\bf Heuristics:} Mathematical definition and descriptions for your heuristic functions, including what they measure, and why they are admissible.

{\bf Performance Metrics:} for each of the heuristic, run the five puzzles and report the number of nodes generated (i.e put on the frontier queue) and the number of nodes visited, in a table.

{\bf Discussion:} Discuss the results. Whether they are consistent with how you expected the results to turn out, along with the other observations for experiments and three different heuristics employed.
